NAME
----
globus-gram-audit - Load GRAM5 audit records into a database

SYNOPSIS
--------
*globus-gram-audit* [ --conf 'CONFIG-FILE' ] 
    [ --create | --update='OLD-VERSION' ]
    [ --check ]
    [ --delete ]
    [ --audit-directory='AUDITDIR' ]
    [ --quiet ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *globus-gram-audit* program loads audit records to an SQL-based database.
It reads +/etc/globus-job-manager.conf+ by default to determine the audit
directory and then uploads all files in that directory that contain valid audit
records to the database configured by the
*globus_gram_job_manager_auditing_setup_scripts* package. If the upload
completes successfully, the audit files will be removed.

The full set of command-line options to *globus-gram-audit*
consist of:

*--conf 'CONFIG-FILE'*::
    Use 'CONFIG-FILE' instead of the default from the configuration file for
    audit database configuration.

*--check*::
    Check whether the insertion of a record was successful by querying the
    database after inserting the records. This is used in tests.

*--delete*::
    Delete audit records from the database right after inserting them. This is
    used in tests to avoid filling the databse with test records.

*--audit-directory 'AUDITDIR'*::
    Look for audit records in 'AUDITDIR', instead of looking in the directory
    specified in the job manager configuration. This is used in tests to
    control which records are loaded to the database and then deleted.

*--query 'SQL'*::
    Perform the given SQL query on the audit database. This uses the database
    information from the configuration file to determine how to contact the
    database.

*--quiet*::
    Reduce the amount of output for common operations.

FILES
-----
The *globus-gram-audit* uses the following files:


*/etc/globus-gram-job-manager.conf*::
    GRAM5 job manager configuration. It includes the
    default path to the audit directory

*/etc/globus-gram-audit.conf*::
    Audit configuration. It includes the information needed to contact the
    audit database.
