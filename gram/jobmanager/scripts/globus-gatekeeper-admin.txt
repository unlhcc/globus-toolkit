NAME

globus-gatekeeper-admin - Manage globus-gatekeeper services

SYNOPSIS
--------

*globus-gatekeeper-admin* [-h]

*globus-gatekeeper-admin* -l [-n 'NAME']

*globus-gatekeeper-admin* -e 'SERVICE' [-n 'NAME']

*globus-gatekeeper-admin* -E

*globus-gatekeeper-admin* -d 'SERVICE'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *globus-gatekeeper-admin* program manages service entries which are used by
the *globus-gatekeeper* to execute services. Service entries are located in the
+/etc/grid-services+ directory. The *globus-gatekeeper-admin* can list, enable,
or disable specific services, or set a service as the default. The '-h'
command-line option shows a brief usage message.

The *-l* command-line option to *globus-gatekeeper-admin* will cause it
to list all of the services which are available to be run by the 
*globus-gatekeeper*. In the output, the service
name will be followed by its status in brackets. Possible status
strings are *ENABLED*, *DISABLED*, and *ALIAS to 'NAME'*, where
'NAME' is another service name.

If the *-n 'NAME'* is used, then only information about the service named
'NAME' is printed.

The *-e 'SERVICE'* command-line option to *globus-gatekeeper-admin* will cause
it to enable a service so that it may be run by the *globus-gatekeeper*.

If the *-n 'NAME'* option is used as well, then the service will be enabled
with the alias 'NAME'.

The *-E* command-line option to *globus-gatekeeper-admin* will cause it to
enable a service alias with the name +jobmanager+. The
*globus-gatekeeper-admin* program will choose the first service it finds as the
default. To enable a particular service as the default, use the *-e* parameter
described above with the *-n* parameter.

The *-d 'SERVICE'* command-line option to *globus-gatekeeper-admin* will cause
it to disable a service so that it may not be run by the *globus-gatekeeper*.
All aliases to a disabled service are also disabled.
