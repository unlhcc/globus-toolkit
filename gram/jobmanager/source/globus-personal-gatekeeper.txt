NAME
----
globus-personal-gatekeeper - Manage a user's personal gatekeeper daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
*globus-personal-gatekeeper* [-help ] [-usage ] [-version ] [-versions ] [-list ] [-directory 'CONTACT'] 

== Description ==

The *globus-personal-gatekeeper* command is a utility which
manages a gatekeeper and job manager service for a single user.
Depending on the command-line arguments it will operate in one of
several modes. In the first set of arguments indicated in the synopsis,
the program provides information about the
*globus-personal-gatekeeper* command or about instances of the
*globus-personal-gatekeeper* that are running currently. The
second set of arguments indicated in the synopsis provide control over
starting a new *globus-personal-gatekeeper* instance. The final
set of arguments provide control for terminating one or more
*globus-personal-gatekeeper* instances. 

The '-start' mode will create a new subdirectory of $HOME/.globus
and write the configuration files needed to start a  and write the
configuration files needed to start a *globus-gatekeeper* daemon
which will invoke the *globus-job-manager* service when new
authenticated connections are made to its service port. The
*globus-personal-gatekeeper* then exits, printing the contact
string for the new gatekeeper prefixed by GRAM contact:  to standard
output. In addition to the arguments described above, any arguments
described in *globus-job-manager(8)* can be appended to the
command-line and will be added to the job manager configuration for the
service started by the *globus-gatekeeper*. 

The new *globus-gatekeeper* will continue to run in the background
until killed by invoking *globus-personal-gatekeeper* with the
'-kill' or '-killall' argument. When killed, it will kill the
*globus-gatekeeper* and *globus-job-manager* processes,
remove state files and configuration data, and then exit. Jobs which are
running when the personal gatekeeper is killed will continue to run, but
their job directory will be destroyed so they may fail in the LRM. 

The full set of command-line options to
*globus-personal-gatekeeper* consists of: 

*-help, -usage*::
     Print command-line option summary and exit

*-version*::
     Print software version

*-versions*::
     Print software version including DiRT information

*-list*::
     Print a list of all currently running personal gatekeepers. These entries will be printed one per line.

*-directory 'CONTACT'*::
     Print the configuration directory for the personal gatekeeper with the contact string 'CONTACT'.

*-debug*::
     Print additional debugging information when starting a personal gatekeeper. This option is ignored in other modes.

*-start*::
     Start a new personal gatekeeper process.

*-jmtype 'LRM'*::
     Use 'LRM' as the local resource manager interface. If not provided when starting a personal gatekeeper, the job manager will use the default fork LRM.

*-auditdir 'AUDIT_DIRECTORY'*::
     Write audit report files to 'AUDIT_DIRECTORY'. If not provided, the job manager will not write any audit files.

*-port 'PORT'*::
     Listen for gatekeeper TCP/IP connections on the port 'PORT'. If not provided, the gatekeeper will let the operating system choose.

*-log[='DIRECTORY']*::
     Write job manager log files to 'DIRECTORY'. If 'DIRECTORY' is omitted, the default of $HOME will be used. If this option is not present, the job manager will not write any log files. will be used. If this option is not present, the job manager will not write any log files.

*-seg*::
     Try to use the SEG mechanism to receive job state change information, instead of polling for these. These require either the system administrator or the user to run an instance of the *globus-job-manager-event-generator* program for the LRM specified by the '-jmtype' option.

*-acctfile 'ACCOUNTING_FILE'*::
     Write gatekeeper accounting entries to 'ACCOUNTING_FILE'. If not provided, no accounting records are written.


EXAMPLES
--------

This example shows the output when starting a new personal gatekeeper
which will schedule jobs via the lsf LRM, with debugging enabled.
