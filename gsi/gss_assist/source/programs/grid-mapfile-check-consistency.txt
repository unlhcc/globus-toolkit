NAME
----
grid-mapfile-check-consistency - Add an entry to a grid map file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*grid-mapfile-check-consistency* [ -h | -help | -usage | -version | -versions ]

*grid-mapfile-check-consistency* [ -mapfile 'MAPFILE' | -f 'MAPFILE' ]
  
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *grid-mapfile-check-consistency* program performs basic checks for validity
of a gridmap file.  These checks include checks for existence, duplication of
entries, and valid local user names. If the gridmap file is valid,
*grid-mapfile-check-consistency* exits with a zero exit code, otherwise it
exits with a non-zero exit code. In either case, it displays information about
its progress as it parses and validates the gridmap file.
    
By default, *grid-mapfile-check-consistency* will check the gridmap file named
by the +GRIDMAP+ environment variable if present. If that variable is not set,
it will check the file +$HOME/.gridmap+ for non-root users if present. If that
doesn't exist or *grid-mapfile-check-consistency* is run as root, it will then
check +/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile+. This can be changed by the use of the
'-mapfile' or '-f' command-line options.
    
The full set of command-line options to *grid-mapfile-check-consistency* are:

*-h, -help, -usage*::
    Display the command-line options to *grid-mapfile-check-consistency*.

*-version, -versions*::
    Display the version number of the *grid-mapfile-check-consistency* command.

*-mapfile 'MAPFILE', -f 'MAPFILE'*::
    Check the gridmap file named by 'MAPFILE' instead of the default.

EXAMPLES
--------
Check that the gridmap file in +/etc/grid-security+ is valid:

    % grid-mapfile-check-consistency* -f /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
    Checking /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
    Verifying grid mapfile existence...OK
    Checking for duplicate entries...OK
    Checking for valid user names...OK
==============================================================================

Check a gridmap file that has an invalid local user name:
    
==============================================================================
    grid-mapfile-check-consistency -f /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
    Checking /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
    Verifying grid mapfile existence...OK
    Checking for duplicate entries...OK
    ERROR: baduser is not a valid local username
    ERROR: Found 1 invalid username(s)
