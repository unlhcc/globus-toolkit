NAME
----
grid-mapfile-delete-entry - Remove entries from a gridmap file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*grid-mapfile-delete-entry* [ -help | -usage | -version | -versions ]

*grid-mapfile-delete-entry* -dn 'DISTINGUISHED-NAME' -ln LOCAL-NAME...  [ -d | -dryrun ] [ -mapfile MAPFILE | -f MAPFILE ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *grid-mapfile-delete-entry* program deletes mappings from a gridmap file.
If both the '-dn' and '-ln' options are specified, *grid-mapfile-delete-entry*
removes entries which meet both criteria (remove entries mapping
'DISTINGUISHED-NAME' to 'LOCAL-NAME' for each 'LOCAL-NAME' specified). If only
'-dn' or '-ln' is specified *all* entries for the specified
'DISTINGUISHED-NAME' or 'LOCAL-NAME' are removed.

By default, *grid-mapfile-delete-entry* will modify the gridmap file named by
the +GRIDMAP+ environment variable if present, or the file
+/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile+ if not. This can be changed by the use of the
'-mapfile' or '-f command-line options.

Prior to modifying a gridmap file, *grid-mapfile-delete-entry* saves its
current contents to a file with the string +.old+ appended to
the original file name.

The full set of command-line options to *grid-mapfile-delete-entry* are:

*-help, -usage*::
    Display the command-line options to *grid-mapfile-delete-entry*.

*-version, -versions*::
    Display the version number of the *grid-mapfile-delete-entry* command. The
    second form includes more details.

*-dn DISTINGUISHED-NAME*::
    The X.509 distinguished name to remove from the gridmap file. If the '-ln'
    option is not specified, remove all entries for this name; otherwise,
    remove entries that match both this name and the local name.  The name
    should be in OpenSSL's +oneline+ format.

*-ln LOCAL-NAME...*::
    The POSIX user name to remove from the gridmap file. Include multiple
    'LOCAL-NAME' strings after the '-ln' command-line option to remove multiple
    names from the gridmap. If the '-dn' option is not specifeid, remove all
    entries for these names; otherwise, remove entries that match the
    'DISTINGUISHED-NAME' and any of the 'LOCAL-NAME' values.

*-d, -dryrun*::
    Display diagnostics about what would be removed from the gridmap file, but
    don't actually modify the file.

*-mapfile MAPFILE, -f MAPFILE*::
    Modify the gridmap file named by 'MAPFILE' instead of the
    default.

EXAMPLES
--------
Remove all mappings for a distinguished name:
    
==============================================================================
    % grid-mapfile-delete-entry "/DC=org/DC=example/DC=grid/CN=Joe User"
    Modifying /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile ...
    Deleting entry: "/DC=org/DC=example/DC=grid/CN=Joe User" juser,juser2
    (1) entry deleted
==============================================================================

Remove the mapping between a distinguished name and a single local username:

==============================================================================
    % grid-mapfile-delete-entry "/DC=org/DC=example/DC=grid/CN=Joe User" -ln juser2
    Modifying /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile ...
    Current entry: "/DC=org/DC=example/DC=grid/CN=Joe User" juser
    (1) mapping removed: (juser2), (0) not present and ignored
    (0) entries deleted
